                    Most people would consider me a computer nerd which I embrase.
                    I have been in the computer world since I was 10 years old working with hardware and software.
                    I also have a passion for anything with a motor or engine and normally can fix it if it is broken. 
                    I have spent a lot of time in the City, Suburbs, and Country. There is not really one I enjoy more than
                    the other as they all have their own fun and interesting aspects.

                        I grew up in Wayne, a small town in the the west suburbs of Chicago until I was 10.
                        From there I moved to a very small town Sidell which is between Danville and Champaign until I was 15.
                        Moved once again to the west suburbs of chicago where I stayed bouncing around the suburbs
                       until moving back to central Illinois when I was 28.

                        I have done everything from being a paper boy to employing 5 people in the computer business.
                        I started my first company in online advertising when I was 15 and stayed focused there for
                        about 19 years. When I moved back to centeral Illinois I started a small computer repair business,
                        mostly for just surrounding towns to keep me busy in my downtime. The business has grown a little
                        over the years. I have held classes at the local library teaching people how to use their computers,
                        tablets, phone, and how to stay away from online identity theft. I have also expanded into fixing
                        Point Of Sale (POS) systems and setting up security camera systems. I shut down my advertising
                        side of things when I started to go back to school as it took up about 14 hours a day and I did not have the time
                        to maintain it. I may get back into advertising in the future however I have some other ideas I would
                        like to explore first. Between my classes, homework, and the computer business I have a job
                        at a local auto parts store. This is my first job where I have not been self employed since I was
                        15 years old so it is interesting, fun, and a bit of a shock.

                        I have gone to College of DuPage in the past but I did not stick with it. Many years later 
                        I am attending Parkland College for software programming. I would like to clearn c++ and be able to
                        make my own programs such as apps for mobile devices, mainstream programs for every day use helping people accomplish
                        their everyday tasks, and most likely a few underground private programs. I may go into business management
                        in the programming field as it is more lucrative managing a team than just being a small part.
                        Time will tell in that situation as what direction I will go, most likely I will pursue both. 
                        One of my classes is a HTML / CSS 5 class
                        which is where this page is coming from as it is one of my assignments. I am also making a webiste for
                        my computer business since I never bothered to make one as most of my business comes from word of mouth,
                        however it will be nice to show what my services can provide.

                        In my spare time on a lazy day I enjoy watching tv, movies, documentaries.
                        When the weather is nice I like to get out in the garage and work on my car,
                        rc car, golf cart, things to get my hands dirty and get away from my desk. Being
                        able to get out of the office to build something and drive it around is always nice.
                        Some of the
                        most fun and relaxing things I can think of is putting something together,
                        going fast, and knowing that I built it. Out of the garage I like to golf, bowling,
                        going out to eat. I was a big fan of urban exploring and learning the history of old buildings, seeing how
                        they were made, and what they were used for. I do not do much of that anymore since
                        most of the time that involves trasspassing.
